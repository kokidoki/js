      <p style="font-size: 10px">The Maze Runner is a dystopian about Thomas who wakes up in a maze with the intent of getting out. This book has a really good plot that will make you want to keep reading. The characters in the story make the book very interesting. Thomas and his friends are faced with many problems to overcome. This is a great book and I highly recommend it to anyone how wants a good story.</p>
